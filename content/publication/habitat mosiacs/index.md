abstract: Watersheds are complex mosaics of habitats whose conditions vary across space andtime as landscape features filter overriding climate forcing, yet the extent to which thereliability of ecosystem services depends on these dynamics remains unknown. Wequantified how shifting habitat mosaics are expressed across a range of spatial scaleswithin a large, free-flowing river, and how they stabilize the production of Pacific salmonthat support valuable fisheries. The strontium isotope records of ear stones (otoliths)show that the relative productivity of locations across the river network, as both natal- andjuvenile-rearing habitat, varies widely among years and that this variability is expressedacross a broad range of spatial scales, ultimately stabilizing the interannual production offish at the scale of the entire basin.
