The  Alaska  Department  of  Fish  and  Game,  Division  of  Commercial  Fisheries,  estimates  the  number  of  sockeye  Oncorhynchus  nerka  salmon  that  have  passed  through  the  commercial  fishery  but,  have  not  reached  escapement  counting  tower  projects  in  Bristol  Bay,  Alaska.  Inriver  gillnet  test  fisheries  are  used  to  develop  indices  of  relative  abundance of sockeye salmon in the Kvichak, Egegik, and Ugashik rivers. These indices in combination with catch and escapement data are used for inseason management of commercial fisheries in the Kvichak/Naknek, Egegik, and Ugashik districts.
