The  Alaska  Department  of  Fish  and  Game  (ADF&G),  Division  of  Commercial  Fisheries,  monitors  annual escapements of sockeye Oncorhynchus nerka salmon returning the major drainages in Bristol Bay, Alaska. Tower counts, are  used  to  develop  escapement  estimates  of  sockeye,  Chinook O.  Tshawytcha,  chum O.  keta,  coho O. kisutch, and pink O.  gorbuscha salmon into the Ugashik, Egegik, Naknek, Alagnak, Kvichak, Wood, Igushik, and Togiak  rivers.  Research staff are responsible for supervising the towers located on the west side of Bristol Bay--Togiak, Igushik and Wood river. Tower  escapement  estimates  are  used  for  inseason  management of  commercial  fisheries  in  the Ugashik, Egegik, Naknek/Kvichak, Nushagak, and Togiak districts. Estimates of species composition, age, sex, and length, are derived from samples obtained with beach seines. This report provides operational guidelines for the Bristol Bay Counting Tower projects, estimation of salmon escapement, sampling procedures, and general camp policies.
