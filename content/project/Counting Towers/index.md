The  Alaska  Department  of  Fish  and  Game  (ADF&G),  Division  of  Commercial  Fisheries,  monitors  annual escapements of sockeye Oncorhynchus nerka salmon returning the major drainages in Bristol Bay, Alaska. Tower counts, are  used  to  develop  escapement  estimates  of  sockeye _Oncorhynchus nerka_,  Chinook _O.  Tshawytcha_,  chum _O. keta_,  coho _O. kisutch_, and pink _O. gorbuscha_ salmon into the Ugashik, Egegik, Naknek, Alagnak, Kvichak, Wood, Igushik, and Togiak  rivers.  Research staff are responsible for supervising the towers located on the west side of Bristol Bay--Togiak, Igushik and Wood river. Estimates of species composition, age, sex, and length, are derived from samples obtained with beach seines.
