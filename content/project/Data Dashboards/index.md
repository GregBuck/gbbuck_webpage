I have been working on making data dashboards. Using the Shiny package I can build and post rapid data dashboards designed to help staff understand our data.

[Here](https://gregbuck.shinyapps.io/tog_herr_dashboard2/?_ga=2.219852443.348790948.1599781024-323279439.1599781024) is an example designed to explore age, sex length (ASL) data collected during the 2019 Togiak herring fishery. I was able to update this dashboard daily.
