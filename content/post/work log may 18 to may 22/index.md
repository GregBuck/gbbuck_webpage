Monday: C&E tables. refresher trainng for Stacy on herring sampling. Turns out our existing protocol just died with the old laptop we were using to sync handheld too.  Not possible to configure newer computer to work with our obsolete system. Have to come up with and implement a plan B this year. 

Tuesday: Two options for herring sampling: 1) use existing handheld/software without syncing to ACCESS on laptop. 2) develop R-GUI app that will be safer/quicker than direct data entry into a spreadsheet. Work on ordering tab sequence on R-GUI app.
