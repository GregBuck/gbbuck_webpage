Monday: Leave 

Tuesday: Beta test prototype measuring board. Discussed with Roy. Appears to work adequately. It is a bit sensitive to 'long' vs. 'short' presses of the buttons to toggle between calibration and measurement mode. Will make that more clear in the user manual

Wednesday: QA/QC 2020 salmon ASL data to ID scales that Stacy ought to review (outliers)

Thursday/Friday: R code to query OceanAK and generate C & E report tables
