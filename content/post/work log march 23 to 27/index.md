Monday: work on code to build tables for C&E report

Tuesday: investigate possibility of using Rstudio through Citrix. It appears to be possible. Submit request to network services to consider adding Rstudio to citrix.

Wednesday: Reactivate this webpage and get it configured to be updated on my work computer. (Previously built on my personal machine on my own time.) I plan on using the 'blog' section of this website to make a brief weekly worklog.

Thursday: Continue working on a data collection app for togiak herring sampling. Current data collection is done using a 10+ year old mobile computer running a non-supported app that I created in 2008 running on a non-supported OS (Windows Mobile). We have no backup other than paper and pencil.

Friday: Personal Leave
